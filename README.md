# discord-frankbot

A custom discord bot I built for a server my friends and I play on. It can do the following

1. Roll a single die. Random number from 1 to 6. !roll
2. Give basic server info. !server
3. Give a single ingredient and get a random drink recipe with the name, image, recipe and measurements. Using a REST api. https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php
